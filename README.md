## Introduction to Coding with Python

This GitHub hosts the materials used in the Smithsonian Institution workshop: **Introduction to Coding using Python**

The purpose of the workshop is to teach participants introductory coding techniques. We have chosen to teach these in the context of the Python language. Python has gained widespread use throughout academia and industry. Its simple syntax has made it a popular first language for budding coders. However, even though the course is taught in the context of Python, the focus will be on teaching computational thinking and techniques.
