    "The first is that each sequence line will have a special character at the end of the line. On MAC/Un\\*x, this will be `\\n`. On Windows machines, line endings are different, e.g. `\\r`. We will need to either ignore those characters or remove them from each sequence before we calculate the gc content. We will do this with a special string method called `.strip()`. This takes a character as an argument, then chops it off at the end of a string.\n",
    "\n",
    "The second is that for this example, we will have a loop inside of a loop. The first loop will loop through the lines in the file, while the second will loop through the characters in the string. Note that you should be careful when using nested loops like this. They can greatly increase the complexity of your program and the resulting time needed to run them."

    "There are some things that we could have done differently that might make this code more robust. For example, instead of using the `.strip()` method, we could have just counted the number of `ACTG`s and divide that by the number of `C` and `G`. We could also have translated the whole sequence into uppercase letters so that we didn't miss any lowercase or soft masked nucleotides. While we are doing all of that, we could also check for characters that aren't `ACTG` and throw an error when we encounter them (keeping in mind that we wouldn't want to throw an error for a `\\n`. \n",

    "This might be a bit better than our example above, but we could still make it more robust to problems with the data. For example, it's probably better to raise an error when there is a character that doesn't match your expectations. This *forces* the user to fix their problem before moving on, which is usually the best call depending on how important the error is. You can raise a `ValueError` to do that. We will go over an example where we do this in our next section on functions."
