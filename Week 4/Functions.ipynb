    "Functions are a key component of programming. We have already used functions several times in this course. Some examples include `len()`, `range()`, and `max()`. In this section we will learn how to write our own functions. When programming, it often becomes important to conduct the same set of operations many times. Wrapping up these operations into a function allows us to write that code only once, then call the function each time that we want to conduct that particular set of operations. It also isolates that chunk of code into a single place, which really helps when we have to debug our code."

    "To define a function, we must follow some standard Python syntax. Say we want to create a function that adds two integers together. First, we must give it a name, such as `add_these`. To start this function, we use `def` followed by a unique name and parentheses:\n",

    "def add_these():\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In this case, we wish to add to integers, so we have to feed the function some arguments. We enclose these in the parentheses. This will allow us to accept numbers and add them together. Note that whatever the user feeds to the function will be automatically assigned to the variables `a` and `b` and **in that order**. If the user feeds too many or too few arguments to the function, it will result in an error.\n",
